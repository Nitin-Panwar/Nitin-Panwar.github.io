Hi i am nitin panwar. I love to read about new technologies and love to play cricket.

Next you can update site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

Hello Niitn panwar

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
