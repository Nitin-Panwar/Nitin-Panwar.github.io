If you ask any industry expert, what language should you learn for big data, they would definitely suggest you to start with Scala. Scala has gained a lot of recognition for itself and is used by the large number of companies. Scala and Spark are being used at Facebook, NetFlix for Big Data and Machine Learning applications.

But, learning a new language can be intimidating. To help you learn Scala from scratch, I have created this comprehensive guide. The guide is aimed at beginners and enables you to write simple codes in Apache Spark using Scala. I have kept the content simple to get you started.

By the end of this guide, you will have a thorough understanding of working with Apache Spark in Scala. Read on to learn one more language and add more skills to your resume.

### 1. What is Scala?

Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. It is a general-purpose programming language designed for the programmers who want to write programs in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. Scala enables programmers to be more productive. Scala is developed as an object-oriented and functional programming language.

If you write a code in Scala, you will see that the style is similar to a scripting language. Even though Scala is a new language, it has gained enough users and has a wide community support. It is one of the most user-friendly languages.

The design of Scala started in 2001. Scala made its first public appearance in January 2004 on the JVM platform and a few months later in June 2004, it was released on the .(dot)NET platform. The .(dot)NET support of Scala was officially dropped in 2012.Scala is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Scala is an object and any operations you perform is a method call. Scala, allow you to add new operations to existing classes with the help of implicit classes. One of the advantages of Scala is that it makes it very easy to interact with Java code. You can also write a Java code inside Scala class. The Scala supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.Scala is a programming language that has implemented major functional programming concepts. In Functional programming, every computation is treated as a mathematical function which avoids states and mutable data. The functional programming exhibits following characteristics:

..* Power and flexibility
    Simplicity
    Suitable for parallel processing

Scala is not a pure functional language. Haskell is an example of a pure functional language.

### 2. Scala is a compiler based language (and not interpreted)

Scala is a compiler based language which makes Scala execution very fast if you compare it with Python (which is an interpreted language). The compiler in Scala works in similar fashion as Java compiler. It gets the source code and generates Java byte-code that can be executed independently on any standard JVM (Java Virtual Machine). If you want to know more about the difference between complied vs interpreted language please refer this article.

There are more important points about Scala which I have not covered. Some of them are:

Scala has thread based executors
Scala is statically typed language
Scala can execute Java code
You can do concurrent and Synchronized processing in Scala
Scala is JVM based languages
