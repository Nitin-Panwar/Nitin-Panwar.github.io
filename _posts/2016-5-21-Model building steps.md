title: A Complete Tutorial to Learn Data Science with Python from Scratch
published: true
---

Due to lack of resource on python for data science. I decided to create this tutorial to help many others to learn python faster. In this tutorial we will take bite sized information about how to use Python for data Analysis, chew it till we are comfortable and practice it at our end.

## Why Python?
- Open Source 
- Awesome online community
- Easy to learn


Needless to say. It still has few drawbacks too
- It is interpreted language rather than compiled language - hence might take up more CPU time.

**Following are a list of libraries, You will need for any scientific computations and data analysis:**
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python. The most powerful feature of NumPy is n-dimensional array. This library also contains basic linear algebra functions. Fourier transformations, advanced random number capablities and tools for integration with other low level languages like Fortran, C and C++.
- SciPy stands for Scientific Python. SciPy is built on NumPy. It is oe of the most useful library for veriety of high level science and engineering modules like discrete Fourier transform, Linear Algebra, Optimization and Sparse matrices.
- Matplotlib for plotting vast variety of graphs, starting from histograms to line plots to heat plots. You can use Pylab feature in ipython notebook(ipython notebook - pylab = inline) to use these plotting features inline. If you ignore the inline option then pylab converts ipython enviornment to an environment very similar to Matlab. You can also use Latex commands to add math to your plot.
- Pandas for structured data operations and manipulations. It is extensively used for data munging and prepration. Pandas were added recently to Python and have been instrumental in boosting Python's usage in data scientist
