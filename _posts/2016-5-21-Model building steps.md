published: true
---

Due to lack of resource on python for data science. I decided to create this tutorial to help many others to learn python faster. In this tutorial we will take bite sized information about how to use Python for data Analysis, chew it till we are comfortable and practice it at our end.

## Why Python?
- Open Source 
- Awesome online community
- Easy to learn


Needless to say. It still has few drawbacks too
- It is interpreted language rather than compiled language - hence might take up more CPU time.

## Following are a list of libraries, You will need for any scientific computations and data analysis:
**NumPy** stands for Numerical Python. The most powerful feature of NumPy is n-dimensional array. This library also contains basic linear algebra functions. Fourier transformations, advanced random number capablities and tools for integration with other low level languages like Fortran, C and C++.
SciPy stands for Scientific Python
