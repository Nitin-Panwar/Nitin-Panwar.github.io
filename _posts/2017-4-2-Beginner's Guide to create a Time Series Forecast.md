TS(Time Series) is considered to be one of the less known skill in the analytics space. Time series is a collection of data points collected at constant time intervals. But what makes a TS different from regular regression problem are- 

1. It is time dependent, so the basic assumption of linear regression model that the observations are independent doesn't hold in this case.
2. Along with an increasing or decreasing trends, most TS have some form of seasionality trends. For example. If you see the sales of woolen jacket over time, you will invariably find higher sales in winter season.
