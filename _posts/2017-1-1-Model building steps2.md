published: true
---

I have been using ggplot to plot in python but the limitation of ggplot is that it is not much interactive. Then my exploration started and i found D3.js a good alternative to plot interactive graphs. D3.js is not much famous in Data science comunity because it reqires knowleedge of jave script and css. Today, I am going to tell you something which will change the way you perform data visualizations in the language / tool of your choice (R, Python, MATLAB, Perl, Julia, Arduino).
