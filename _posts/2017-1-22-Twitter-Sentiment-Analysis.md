Learning new things are always exciting. Today i will be sharing about Twitter sentiment analysis but first we need to get old data. Using Twitter API it is not possible to get older tweets. To get older data i am using the [I'm using Jefferson utility](https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python). Clone this repository in your local machine and run below command to get 6000 tweets from 1-12-2015 to 2-12-2015 of #ChannaiFloods.

```
python Exporter.py --querysearch "ChennaiFloods" --since 2015-12-1 --until 2015-12-2 --maxtweets 6000
```
